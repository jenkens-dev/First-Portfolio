Self taught programmer and web developer. I normally don't know what I'm doing but I'm trying to learn. I spend my free time playing video games or Magic the Gathering. I'm looking to use this site to test out and catalog my projects. First thing I'll be doing is journeying through game development. I was first inspired by the story of Stardew Valley, a one man success story who had little coding experience and made a great game all by himself! Come join me through my journey into the programming world.
