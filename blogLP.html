		<h2>Coming Soon!</h2>
		<p>I encourage everyone to start their own blog or at least a small journal. While you may think no one will listen to you, you're barely scraping by as is, a blog is not only great for other people but yourself too! Trying to explain and teach others is one of the best ways to learn yourself, you put ideas and logic in your own words, which helps cement them in your mind and increase your understanding. Programming is one of the most difficult things I've ever done, and with all the technology out there it's easy to feel like you aren't processing fast enough, or even at all. A journal can help you see everything you've learned throughout your journey and how much you've grown. Best of luck, and thank you for reading!</p>
